{"name":"ebFRET","tagline":"ebFRET performs combined analysis on multiple single-molecule FRET time series to learn a set of rates and states ","body":"### Consensus analysis of many single-molecule FRET time series\r\n\r\nebFRET is a library written in Matlab for the analysis of single-molecule FRET time series with hidden Markov models. \r\n\r\n![Example Traces](https://raw.github.com/ebfret/paper-icml/master/figures/fig_example_traces_500dpi.png)\r\n\r\nIt is the successor of [vbFRET](http://vbfret.sourceforge.net), which it improves upon by performing combined analysis of multiple time series at once. This approach, known as _empirical Bayes_, is both more accurate and statistically robust. It also enables more advanced analysis use cases such as sub-population detection.\r\n\r\n![Inference Accuracy](https://raw.github.com/ebfret/paper-icml/master/figures/fig_accuracy_vs_noise_v2_500dpi.png)\r\n\r\n### Example Usage\r\n```\r\ndata = load_fret('my_data.dat');\r\neb = eb_fret(data.fret, [2,3,4], 10);\r\ntracePlotter(data.fret, 'vit', eb(3).vit);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Get the Source\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a stand-alone GUI for usage in a lab environment.
